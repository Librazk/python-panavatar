Introduction
============

Being "between jobs" I had some time on my hands, so I decided to spice up my desktop environment. While there is a large range of high quality desktop backgrounds available, I really wanted to make my own. As I am a crappy artist, I ran to python; this is the result.

About seeds
==============

I'll be using semantic versioning. Seeds will produce similar results within a major version, and identical results within a minor version. Of course, the 0.* versions carry no guarantee whatsoever.
