Introduction to PanAvatar
============

In a recent project, I had to assign a unique header to a couple of pages. I am a crappy artist, so I decided to have these images auto-generated. Each image is generated using a seed, which is used to create a random number generator. With this random number generator, a large number of decisions are made to lay out a tiling pattern, distort and color it.

PanAvatar could be made to generate avatars. Not just for users, but also for articles, clients, case-files, and any other model you may have.

Installation
===========

Just use `pip install panavatar`.

About seeds
===========

I'll be using semantic versioning. Seeds will produce similar results within a major version, and identical results within a minor version. Of course, the 0.* versions carry no guarantee whatsoever.
